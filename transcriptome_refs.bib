   abstract = {Adenoviruses (family Adenoviridae) are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles with linear, double-stranded DNA genomes of 26–45kbp containing inverted terminal repeats of 36–368bp. Adeoviruses have been isolated from every major vertebrate class from fish to mammals. Members of genus Mastadenovirus occur in mammals and those of genus Aviadenovirus are found in birds. Reptilian adenoviruses belong to genus Atadenovirus, but other at adenoviruses occur also in ruminants, birds, and a marsupial (possibly as a result of host class switches) and have a high A+T content in these hosts. Genus Siadenovirus contains adenoviruses from birds and a frog, and is named after a putative sialidase gene that is absent from other genera. The single confirmed fish adenovirus falls into a potential fifth genus. Adenoviruses are grouped further into species based mainly on phylogenetic measures. Human (together with chimpanzee) adenoviruses are classified into six species: Human adenovirus A to Human adenovirus F. The structural and biological properties of the mastadenoviruses have been studied in detail, and the characterization of bird and lower vertebrate adenoviruses has just begun. The middle portion of all adenovirus genomes is well conserved, whereas the regions toward the ends are characteristic of genera and sometimes even species. Adenoviruses are popular candidates for vector development with a view to applications in gene therapy, immunization, and antitumor medicine.},

There are still many unsolved questions about adenovirus biology as the growing cases of serious adenovirus infections in immunologically compromised individuals rise. There is still no virus-specific therapy available. Additionally, with the widespread use of adenovirus gene therapy vectors, it is becoming increasingly important to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of infection.},

   title = {Characterization of Avirulent Turkey Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus: A Study of the Molecular Basis for Variation in Virulence and the Occurrence of Persistent Infection},
   university = {Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University},
   type = {Dissertation},
   abstract = {Hemorrhagic enteritis is a disease of turkeys caused by virulent strains of Turkey Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (THEV) resulting in depression, splenomegaly, intestinal hemorrhage, immunosuppression, and mortality. Avirulent strains that do not produce intestinal lesions and mortality are used in live-virus vaccines that protect turkeys from virulent field challenge. The cause for the difference in phenotype between virulent and avirulent strains is unknown. The full-length genome of the Virginia Avirulent Strain (VAS) of THEV was sequenced and compared to the genome sequence of a virulent field isolate from Israel. Genetic differences were found in seven viral genes. Further sequencing narrowed the focus from seven genes to three: ORF1, E3, and Fiber. Consistent variation in these genes between strains of THEV with different phenotypes strongly indicates these genes as key factors affecting virulence. THEV is an officially recognized member of the viral family Adenoviridae, genus Siadenovirus. The genomes of the members of the genus, THEV and Frog Adenovirus 1, are not well-characterized. The genome sequences of both members were compared for the prediction of genetic and structural elements. Common features were found that distinguish this genus from all other adenoviruses, and differences were found that possibly contribute to host specificity of the members. The VAS is known to stimulate a life-long protective antibody response, though viral replication is only of short duration. Several studies were undertaken to determine changes in virus location and serology over time. Viral DNA was detected in various tissues through 15 weeks post-infection in the presence of high antibody titers. THEV infection was found to be similar to the non-lytic persistent infections seen with human adenoviruses. Regardless of the mechanism involved in the persistent stimulation of antibodies in infected turkeys, the VAS was shown to be an ideal vector for use in a recombinant live-virus vaccine. The next step in THEV research should be the creation of a full-length infectious DNA clone, which could be used in the creation of a recombinant vaccine. The infectious clone would also allow for the systematic testing of genes that are suspected to be involved in virulence.},

   abstract = {Turkey hemorrhagic enteritis virus (THEV) is a member of the genus Siadenovirus and causes disease in turkey poults characterized by splenomegaly, bloody diarrhoea and death. The mechanism responsible for intestinal lesion formation and mortality is not known, although there is strong evidence that it is immune-mediated. All strains of THEV are serologically indistinguishable, although there are naturally occurring avirulent strains of THEV that replicate efficiently in turkeys without the intestinal haemorrhage or mortality associated with more virulent strains. The purpose of this study was to determine which viral genes are involved in virulence. The full-length genome of an avirulent vaccine strain was sequenced and compared with the genome of a virulent field isolate from Israel that was sequenced in 1998. Comparison of the two 26.3 kb genomes revealed 49 nucleotide differences resulting in 14 putative amino acid changes within viral proteins. Sequencing of the regions surrounding the 14 missense mutations revealed variations in ORF1, E3 and the fiber (fib) knob domain in five additional strains with varying degrees of virulence. Complete sequences of these genes were determined in a total of 11 different strains of THEV. All strains had at least one missense mutation in ORF1, and all but two of the strains had one missense mutation in E3. At least one missense mutation was found in the fiber knob domain in six out of seven virulent strains. Sequence variation of ORF1, E3 and fib in strains of THEV with different phenotypes strongly indicates that these genes are the key factors affecting virulence.},

   abstract = {Viruses carry nucleic acids between and within host cells. Invariably, virus attachment to host cells leads to activation of cell signalling. These so-called forward signals emerge from interactions with cell surface receptors or cytosolic proteins and elicit profound responses in the cells, for example induction of growth or innate immunity responses. They can enhance or suppress infection. In addition, viruses receive signals from the cell. These reverse signals can impact on the structure of the virus leading to genome uncoating. They can enhance infection or inactivate virus, for example by facilitating degradation. Here we discuss the nature and mechanisms by which forward and reverse signals emerge and affect the outcome of human adenovirus infections. We describe how human adenoviruses use cell surface receptors for forward signalling to activate cell growth, intracellular transport or innate immune response. We also discuss how adenoviruses use acto-myosin, integrins or microtubule-based kinesin motors for reverse signalling to facilitate their stepwise uncoating programme.},

   abstract = {Viral genomes have high gene densities and complex transcription strategies rendering transcriptome analysis through short-read RNA-seq approaches problematic. Adenovirus transcription and splicing is especially complex. We used long-read direct RNA sequencing to study adenovirus transcription and splicing during infection. This revealed a previously unappreciated complexity of alternative splicing and potential for secondary initiating codon usage. Moreover, we find that most viral transcripts tend to shorten polyadenylation lengths as infection progresses. Development of an open reading frame centric bioinformatics analysis pipeline provided a deeper quantitative and qualitative understanding of adenovirus’s genetic potential. Across the viral genome adenovirus makes multiple distinctly spliced transcripts that code for the same protein. Over 11,000 different splicing patterns were recorded across the viral genome, most occurring at low levels. This low-level use of alternative splicing patterns potentially enables the virus to maximise its coding potential over evolutionary timescales.},

The lack of complete consistency between the present and previous results is because of some sites which were incorrectly mapped in previous studies, such as the splice sites for pVII, pVIII and E3-11.6K. Several previously predicted splice sites such as that for E3-14.5K and E4ORF3/4 were not detected. In addition, several new splice sites were identified. The novel RNAs may code for hitherto undetected proteins or alternatively spliced mRNAs for known proteins. The open reading frames downstream of two novel splice sites, located in the major late transcription unit region, were shown to be highly conserved. Another interesting possibility is that some of them are non-coding RNAs. Finally, the adenovirus mRNA polyadenylation sites were accurately mapped and in some cases shown to be heterogeneous.},

   abstract = {Increasingly complex bioinformatic analysis is necessitated by the plethora of sequence information currently available. A total of 21 poxvirus genomes have now been completely sequenced and annotated, and many more genomes will be available in the next few years. First, we describe the creation of a database of continuously corrected and updated genome sequences and an easy-to-use and extremely powerful suite of software tools for the analysis of genomes, genes, and proteins. These tools are available free to all researchers and, in most cases, alleviate the need for using multiple Internet sites for analysis. Further, we describe the use of these programs to identify conserved families of genes (poxvirus orthologous clusters) and have named the software suite POCs, which is available at www.poxvirus.org. Using POCs, we have identified a set of 49 absolutely conserved gene families-those which are conserved between the highly diverged families of insect-infecting entomopoxviruses and vertebrate-infecting chordopoxviruses. An additional set of 41 gene families conserved in chordopoxviruses was also identified. Thus, 90 genes are completely conserved in chordopoxviruses and comprise the minimum essential genome, and these will make excellent drug, antibody, vaccine, and detection targets. Finally, we describe the use of these tools to identify necessary annotation and sequencing updates in poxvirus genomes. For example, using POCs, we identified 19 genes that were widely conserved in poxviruses but missing from the vaccinia virus strain Tian Tan 1998 GenBank file. We have reannotated and resequenced fragments of this genome and verified that these genes are conserved in Tian Tan. The results for poxvirus genes and genomes are discussed in light of evolutionary processes.},

The range of disease associations and biological characteristics found across this group is substantial. Historically, herpesviruses were defined by their characteristic virion architecture: an icosahedral capsid of diameter near 125 nm and with 162 capsomeric spikes embedded in an amorphous proteinaceous matrix (tegument), and enveloped with a lipid membrane carrying external glycoproteins to give an overall diameter of nearly 215 nm. The chapter describes genome sequences and encoded protein sequences to discern processes that have occurred during evolution and constructs a phylogenetic description of the mammalian and avian viruses. The DNA genomes are heterogeneous in terms of size, base composition, gene content, and organization. The overall scheme of herpesvirus evolution elaborates the development of herpesviruses in much the same timeframe as that of the vertebrates.},

   abstract = {Currently, the family Adenoviridae contains five genera, out of which Siadenovirus is one of the two least densely populated ones. A new member representing a new species in this genus has been detected in various birds of prey. The virus, named raptor adenovirus 1 (RAdV-1), could not be isolated, probably because no appropriate permissive cell-line was available. Partial genomic sequences, obtained by PCR and suggesting that the virus is a new siadenovirus species, have been published earlier. In the present paper, determination and analysis of the complete RAdV-1 genome are reported. This is the first complete genome sequence acquired from a non-isolated adenovirus (AdV). The sole source was a mixture of the internal organs of the diseased and dead birds. Until now, the genomic organization considered characteristic to siadenoviruses had been deduced from the detailed study of only two virus species, one of which originated from birds and the other from a frog. The present analysis of RAdV-1 confirmed the genus-specific genetic content and genomic features of siadenoviruses, and a putative novel gene was found as well. In general, AdVs and most of the AdV genera are thought to be strictly host specific. In the genus Siadenovirus, however, two virus species of rather divergent (avian and amphibian) host origin were present when the genus was found. Although by now the greatest number of known siadenoviruses infect birds, the original hosts of the genus remain unknown.},

Sequence comparisons showed that the two viruses have equivalent gene complements, including one gene the product of which is related to sialidases.

Since the genus Siadenovirus has very few known members so far, further study of the virus was intriguing not only from epizootiological but also from taxonomical aspects. The sample, which had been tested in another PCR survey previously, consisted of less than 50μl of extracted nucleic acid. To ensure sufficient target DNA for an extended study, the viral genome had to be preserved. To this end, the sample was subjected to a novel method of non-specific DNA amplification. Using the amplified DNA as target, different PCR and sequencing strategies were applied with consensus or specific primers for the study of the central genome part of the putative tit adenovirus. The sequence of supposedly one half (13,628bp) of the genome was determined including eight full genes between the genes of the IVa2 and hexon proteins. The gene content of the viral genome fragment as well as the results of the phylogenetic analyses with different proteins confirmed the discovery of a new species in the genus Siadenovirus. This is the first report on the detection of an adenovirus in great tits. The methods, described in this work, proved suitable for the recovery of nucleic acid samples that contain irreplaceable microbial genomic DNA but are only available in limited quantities.},

   abstract = {Infection of turkeys with the haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), a type II avian adenovirus, results in varying rates of morbidity and mortality. The disease is characterised by splenomegaly, intestinal haemorrhage, sudden death and immunosuppression. The mechanisms of HEV immunopathogenesis and immunosuppression are not fully understood. Recent studies indicate that immune responses play a central role in disease pathogenesis. HEV infects B cells and macrophages and induces necrosis as well as apoptosis in infected and possibly in by-stander cells. The ability of the infected birds to mount an optimum humoral immune response as well as normal macrophage functions such as phagocytosis may be impaired. Elevated numbers of splenic CD4(+) cells during the acute phase of infection may be associated with viral clearance. Types I and II interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis-like factors (TNF) are released at the peak of the infection. Cytokines may play a protective as well as a destructive role. While a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to systemic shock associated with haemorrhagic enteritis and death, release of IFNs may protect turkeys from the disease. Treatment with thalidomide, which is a potent TNF down-regulatory drug, prevented HEV-induced intestinal haemorrhage and treatment with an IFN-inducing chemical prevented HEV-replication and inhibited HEV-induced pathological and histopathological lesions.},

Mortality resulting from experimentally produced colibacillosis was significantly increased when Escherichia coli O1:K1 was presented to poults that had been orally inoculated with hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) 1 week earlier. These and previous data suggest that HEV infection can exacerbate colibacillosis of older poults. HEV infection apparently damages the poults' defense system enough to account for the observed increase in susceptibility to E. coli.},

   abstract = {Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell’s regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene.},
